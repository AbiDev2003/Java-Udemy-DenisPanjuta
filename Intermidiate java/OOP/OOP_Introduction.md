# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€“ A Beginnerâ€™s Guide

---

## âœ… What is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which can contain data and methods.

In OOP, everything revolves around real-world entities like **person**, **car**, **employee**, or **student**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Advantages of OOP

- âœ… **Modularity**: Code is divided into smaller reusable classes and objects.
- âœ… **Reusability**: Classes can be reused using **inheritance**.
- âœ… **Scalability**: Easier to scale and maintain large software systems.
- âœ… **Security**: Data hiding using **encapsulation**.
- âœ… **Real-world mapping**: Models real-world entities more naturally.
- âœ… **Maintainability**: Code is cleaner and easier to debug and maintain.

## ðŸ”° Core Features of OOP

| Feature         | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| **1. Class**    | Blueprint or template for creating objects. |
| **2. Object**   | Instance of a class; real-world entity. |
| **3. Encapsulation** | Binding data and methods together and restricting access using access modifiers (e.g., `private`, `public`). |
| **4. Abstraction**   | Hiding internal implementation and showing only essential features (e.g., interfaces, abstract classes). |
| **5. Inheritance**   | One class can inherit fields and methods from another, promoting reusability. |
| **6. Polymorphism**  | Same method name behaves differently in different contexts (e.g., method overloading/overriding). |

## ðŸ“˜ Key Terms

### âž¤ Class
A class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created.
```java
class Car {
    String color;
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving...");
    }
}
```
### âž¤ Object
An object is an instance of a class.

```java
Car myCar = new Car();
```
